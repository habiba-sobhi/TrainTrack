# 📖 Overview

TrainTrack is a relational database project developed to manage and monitor trainee performance within a call center training environment.

Traditional training teams often rely on Excel sheets to track attendance, quizzes, role plays, and test calls. This approach is prone to errors, lacks validation, and requires manual monitoring.

TrainTrack replaces that process with a structured SQL Server solution that:

* Tracks trainees throughout the training lifecycle
* Automatically enforces business rules
* Prevents invalid data entry through constraints
* Generates performance and risk reports
* Automates trainee status updates using SQL triggers
* Provides a simple web interface for trainers

---

# 🎯 Project Objectives

The system was designed to:

* Centralize trainee information
* Track attendance records
* Record quiz and role-play performance
* Manage test call evaluations
* Identify at-risk trainees
* Automate termination and nesting decisions
* Demonstrate advanced SQL Server concepts

# 🗄️ Database Design

## Database Structure

The system consists of **10 fully normalized tables**.

| Table        | Description                                           |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Department   | Stores department information and training duration   |
| Trainer      | Trainer records and contact details                   |
| Batch        | Training batches assigned to departments and trainers |
| Trainee      | Core trainee information                              |
| Attendance   | Daily attendance records                              |
| Quiz         | Quiz definitions                                      |
| Quiz_Attempt | Trainee quiz results                                  |
| Role_Play    | Role play assessments                                 |
| RP_Attempt   | Role play results                                     |
| Test_Call    | Final call evaluation attempts                        |

# 🔄 Database Normalization

The database follows **Third Normal Form (3NF)**.

## First Normal Form (1NF)

* No repeating groups
* All attributes are atomic
* Each record uniquely identified

## Second Normal Form (2NF)

* No partial dependencies
* Data depends on the entire primary key

## Third Normal Form (3NF)

* No transitive dependencies
* Non-key attributes depend only on primary keys

---

# ⚡ Business Rules Automation

One of the project's main goals is enforcing business rules directly inside the database.

## Attendance Rule

If a trainee reaches **3 absences**, the trainee is automatically terminated.

## Quiz Rule

If a trainee fails **3 quizzes**, the trainee is automatically terminated.

## Role Play Rule

If a trainee fails **3 role plays**, the trainee is automatically terminated.

## Test Call Rule

### Passed Test Call

* Status changes to **Nesting**

### Failed All 3 Test Calls

* Status changes to **Terminated**

All rules are enforced through SQL Server triggers.

---

# 🔥 SQL Features Implemented

## Constraints

* PRIMARY KEY
* FOREIGN KEY
* UNIQUE
* NOT NULL
* CHECK

### Example

```sql
CHECK (training_weeks IN (3,4))
```

```sql
CHECK (end_date > start_date)
```

```sql
CHECK (status IN
('Active','Nesting','Graduated','Terminated'))
```

---

## Triggers

### Implemented Triggers

| Trigger                 | Purpose                               |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| trg_check_absences      | Terminates after 3 absences           |
| trg_check_quiz_failures | Terminates after 3 quiz failures      |
| trg_check_rp_failures   | Terminates after 3 role-play failures |
| trg_check_test_call     | Handles nesting and termination logic |
